"You are more certain of the fact of knowing than of anything that you know. The known can always be doubted. This might not be a material world; it might not be the way it appears to be.
But even if it is an illusion, the knowing by which that illusion is known must be real, because an unreal knowing or an unreal consciousness could not know anything."
