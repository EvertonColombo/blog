"Claude doesn't make me much faster on the work that I am an expert on. Maybe 15-20% depending on the day. It's the work that I don't know how to do and would have to research. Or the grunge work I don't even want to do. On this it is hard to even put a number on. Many of the projects I do with Claude day to day I just wouldn't have done at all pre-Claude."
